# Chess-Engine-Project

## Description
This is a chess engine project that I am working on. 
The goal is to create a chess engine that can play against a human player. 
The engine will be able to evaluate the board state and make moves based on the evaluation. 
The engine will also be able to search for the best move using a search algorithm.

## Features
- Board representation
- Move generation
- Move validation
- Board evaluation
- Search algorithm
- User interface - Lichess API (https://lichess.org/api#section/Introduction)
